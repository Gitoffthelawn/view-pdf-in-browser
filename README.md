# view-pdf-in-browser

A browser extension to force PDFs to be viewed inline using your browser instead of downloading to your file system.

Available for Firefox here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/inlinepdf/

# Example

Disable the extension.

Open https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M-Vinay-Kumar/post/Can-anyone-suggest-me-case-study-of-ground-improvement-through-vacuum-consolidation/attachment/5c4e868e3843b0544e62b27d/AS%3A719904953094144%401548650124561/download/Ground_Improvement_Case_Histories_hANSBO.pdf

The PDF will download to your filesystem.

Enable the extension and reload the same link above. It will now open inline in your browsers built in PDF viewer.

# Permissions

This extension request permissions to see data related to all URLs that contain a PDF. This is the most restrictive I
can make this extension while also keeping it useful.
